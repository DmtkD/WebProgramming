__Update/Delete operations are not required for this work!__


Also you must validate the forms using HTML attributes *(inputs must be configured for your data format)*.

If incorrect data is entered in the inputs, you must use JavaScript to inform the user with __modal windows__ or just plain ***alert() function***.

__Bonus points__ are provided for this work, if you implement a styled modal window that will work with JavaScript.


## Requirements:

  * Responsiveness absolutely not required.
  * Styling is not important at all. Is up to you.

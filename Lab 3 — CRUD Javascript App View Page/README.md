# Lab 3 (CRUD Javascript App: View Page)

## Description: 

In this work, you have to make a simple presentation part of a website - **View Page** (You can find the template of these pages by following the [link](https://wireframepro.mockflow.com/view/lviv-iot-crud-js-app#/page/2b044d1d26084553827b6c846eb1db59))

For your blocks you must use **data** from your ***Java/Python project class***.

```
Create a class "Camera" that contains fields:
- name of the manufacturer
- memory capacity (in megabytes)
- zoom factor
```

In case you donâ€™t have a data from previous year, you should choose any free task from this [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RW9PpalOlHn-nVIi8kbCr71vu_XLNsjj4TKpTdBnZ-w/edit?usp=sharing).


Then using JavaScript, you need to implement the following operations on your data *(it is up to you to decide which field should be used for each of the operations)*:

* **Sort** of your items option
* **Search** option
* **Count total amount** of some of the field
***(e.g total price of all cars)***

## Requirements:

* **Responsiveness** absolutely not required.
* **Styling** is not important at all. Is up to you.

## Our recommendations and tips:

* Use JS Array methods: *map(), sort(), filter(), reduce()*
* use native JS for any DOM operations *(querySelector | findById | insertAdjacentHTML | etc)*
